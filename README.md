# YUHacks2021

## Inspiration
Covid-19 has been a stressful experience for many people around the world. We hoped to make something that would help raise awareness, and ease anxiety by keeping people informed and up to date. 

## What it does
Display various Covid-19 related news, statistics, both globally and within Canada. It also provides attractive visualizations of the data, through the internet. It also allows you to book an appointment if you haven't already for any dose.

## How we built it
Java, Android Studio

## Challenges we ran into
Our team was comprised of people with experience as well as people who are new to the field. It was difficult to delegate tasks and keep everyone involved and contributing. We managed to curb the learning curve, by working in teams, and checking each others' work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to successful build our app within the short time frame, considering it's the team's first hackathon.

## What we learned
We learned about android development, implementing APIs, and teamwork.

## What's next for Covid19 Tracker
We'd like to add in the ability to log symptoms to help track long haul covid causes for researchers.
